This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.


Research Contribution
======
* Proposed [Unified fire-induced concrete spalling theory](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2018.06.204), and introduce a design concept of "multiple defense line against fire-induced concrete spalling", which can be applied in (1) UHPC structural system and (2) Significant underground/submerged infrastructure.

主要研究贡献
======
* 提出了混凝土高温剥裂统一理论，发展了现代混凝土结构高温防劣化设计理念，为超高性能混凝土结构以及地下与水下重大混凝土基础设施防火设计提供了新思路。

* 提出了知识增强型机器学习方法预测混凝土高温爆裂，该方法突破了混凝土高温爆裂预测的瓶颈，解决了传统数值模拟方法目前无法大规模高精度有效预测高温爆裂的难题。该方法有潜力用于既有混凝土结构高温爆裂风险评估，以及计划在建结构的混凝土材料防高温爆裂设计。

* 提升了延性水泥基复合材料高温残余力学性能，揭示了不同纤维抑制或促进水泥基复合材料高温爆裂的机理，同时研发了无高温爆裂的超高强延性水泥基复合材料，为延性水泥基复合材料抗火性能提升做出了富有成效的先锋性贡献。
